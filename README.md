# KKV ICBM Intercept Solver

# The project is not user friendly! It was made as a school project.

If you are interested in running it yourself feel free to contact me via Email at `jackneeleman981@gmail.com`. I had a lot of fun writing it.

If you are a TA grading my paper, code that relates to orbital mechanics can be found under `src/kepler_orbit.rs` and `src/lambert_solver.rs`

Interactive plots generated by this program can be found [here](https://icanthink42.github.io/spaceflight_mechanics_plots/)
